        <h1>External Style Sheet</h1>
        <pre>With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

            Each page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <q>link</q> element. The <b>link</b> element goes inside the <b>head</b> section.

            An External Style Sheet can be written in any text editor. The file should not contain any html tags. The style sheet file must be saved with a css extension.
