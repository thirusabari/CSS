        <h1>Margin Collapse</h1>
        <pre>
            Top and bottom margins of elements are sometimes collapsed into a single margin that is equal to the largest of the two margins.

            This does not happen on left and right margins! Only top and bottom margins!

            In this example above, the <b>h1</b> element has a bottom margin of 50px. The <b>pre</b> element has a top margin set to 20px.

            Common Sense would seem to suggest that the vertical margin between the <b>h1</b> and the <b>pre</b> would be a total of 70px(50px+20px). But due to margin collapse, the actual margin ends up being 50px.
