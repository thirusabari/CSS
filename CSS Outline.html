        <h1>CSS Outline</h1>
        <pre>The CSS <b>outline</b> properties specify the style, color, and width of an outline. 
        
        An outline is a line that is drawn around elements (outside the borders) to make the element "stand out".

        However, the outline property is different from the border property. The outline is NOT a part of an element's dimensions; the element's total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline.

        This element has a thin black border and an outline that is 10px wide and green.
