        <h1>The CSS Box Model</h1>
        <pre>All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when taking about design and layout.

            The CSS Box Model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model: 

            Explanation of the different parts: 

            <b>Content</b> - The content of the box, where text and images appear.
            <b>Padding</b> - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent.
            <b>Border</b> - A border that goes around the padding and content.
            <b>Margin</b> - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent.

            The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.
