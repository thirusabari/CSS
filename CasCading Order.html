        <h1>Cascading Order</h1>
        <pre>What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?.

            Generally speaking we can say that all the styles will <b>cascade</b> into a new <b>virtual</b> style sheet by the following rules , where number one has the highest priority.

            <ol>
                <li>Inline Style (inside an HTML element)</li>
                <li>External and Internal style sheets (in the head section)</li>
                <li>Browser Default</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            So, an inline style(inside a specific HTML element) has the highest priority, which means that it will override a style defined inside the <b>head</b> tag, or in an external style sheet, or a browser default value.
