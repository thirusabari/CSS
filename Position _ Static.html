        <h1>Position as Static</h1>
        <pre>HTML elements are positioned static by default.

            Static positioned elements are not affected by the top,bottom, left and right properties.

            An element with <b>position:static</b> is not positioned in any special way, it is always positioned accordinglyto the normal flow of the page.
