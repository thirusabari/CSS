    <h1>Position is Fixed</h1>
    <pre>An element with <b>position:fixed</b> is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom and the left properties are used to position the element. 
    A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page, where it would normally have been located. Notice the fixed element in the lower-right corner of the page.
